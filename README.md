# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
â€¢	Tic-Tac-Toe in Java is a simple two-player game where players take turns marking "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal before the opponent. The game can be implemented using Java with a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI) for player interaction.
